Profile

I am a specialist GCP consultant with a 15-year history in IT, having worked across multiple, enterprise scale GCP implementations over the past 5 years including ANZ Bank and Wesfarmers Health.  I have led engineering teams focused on delivering features on GCP and establishing engineering and platform foundations, including designing solutions deployed using serverless and GKE based applications (including designing highly available VPC native GKE environments), as well as designing data solutions encompassing real-time and batch ETL, metadata, data treatment, data governance solutions and more. I have provided architectural services including writing and presenting Architectural Decision Records (ADR) to peer architecture and am well versed in architectural tools with a focus on C4 & PlantUML. 

Having my career start in Data and move to engineering-focussed has given me a well-rounded background in to tackling and delivering important business problems.
